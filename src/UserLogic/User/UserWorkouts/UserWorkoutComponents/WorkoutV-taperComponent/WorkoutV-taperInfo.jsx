                        <h1>WHAT IS A V TAPER BODY?</h1>
                        <p>The V tape physique is a body shape that has wide shoulders and upper back that tapers down to a narrow waist, creating a V silhouette.</p>
                        <p>The V taper is a widely coveted physique among body builders and fitness enthusiasts alike as, unlike washboard abs or bulging biceps, <br /> having a V taper back can be easily spotted even when fully clothed and shows that the person is committed to training.</p>
                        <p>A V taper body also signifies a balanced training approach as the shoulders and back are clearly worked, vs the more obvious muscles <br /> you see in the mirror such as the chest and biceps.</p>

                        <h1>HOW TO BUILD A V TAPER BODY</h1>
                        <p>There are two elements when it comes to getting a V taper physique:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Increase the width of your upper back and shoulders. This step involves gaining muscle in the upper body muscles through <br /> dedicated strength training.</li>
                            <li>Reduce the size of your waist. This is achieved through losing fat. While it isn't possible to spot reduce from the waist alone, <br />reducing your overall body fat percentage can help to decrease the size of the waist.</li>
                            <li>As the upper back and shoulder width increases and the waist decreases, the difference in size helps to create the V taper.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Latissimus dorsi (lats) - large muscles running from the lower and muddle back, around the side, to the upper arm</li>
                            <li>Deltoids - group of muscles that cover the front (anterior delts), back (posterior delts), and sides (lateral delts) of the shoulders</li>
                            <li>Trapezius (traps) - trapezoid shaped muscle covering the neck and upper mid back</li>
                            <li>Rhomboids - a pair of muscles (rhomboid major and rhomboid minor) in the upper back</li>
                            <li>Obliques - pair of muscles that sit on the sides of the abdomen, running from the ribcage to the pelvis</li>

                        <h1>FAT LOSS FOR A V TAPER</h1>
                        <p>Achieving a V taper physique involves building muscle mass while losing fat</p>
                        <p>To increase muscle mass, you need to focus on muscular hypertrophy focused strength training. This involves a high training volume (at <br />least 2-3 times a week per muscle group), with moderate weights, sets and reps. This provides the muscles with the right kind of stimulus <br /> in the right amount to encourage efficient muscle growth.</p>
                        <p>A calorie surplus is also recommended when it comes to building muscle, however this contrasts with the fat loss many people need to <br /> achieve a classic V taper. Likewise, a large calorie deficit needed for fat loss can slow down or prevent muscle being built.</p>

                        <p>There are two ways to tackle this:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Body recomposition: Eating at, or just below, maintenance calories while training to build muscle can help with body recomposition <br /> by simultaneously losing fat at the same time as building muscle. In this approach, the energy used to build muscle comes from <br /> breaking down body fat. While this approach isn't the most effective way to build muscle or lose fat, it's useful for people who <br />struggle with eating under or over their maintenance calories.</li>
                            <li>Bulking and cutting: The bulk and cut cycle involves focusing on building muscle and losing fat separately. During the bulking <br /> phase, you'll eat in a calorie surplus to encourage muscle growth, and during the cutting phase you'll eat in a calorie deficit for fat <br /> loss while maintaining muscle mass through training. This is an efficient way to change your physique but can be mentally <br /> challenging, particularly during the cutting phase.</li>

                        <p>When it comes to significantly changing your physique through exercise, having a solid workout plan is key. Your workout split needs <br /> to ensure that each muscle group is hit at least twice a week, without neglecting other muscle groups (to prevent imbalances from <br />occurring). Your workout split should also ensure that each muscle group gets at least a full day’s rest between training sessions, and <br /> account for one full rest day each week. Although you can factor core specific workout days, adding a few core and oblique exercises to each workout is a more effective approach. <br /> There are a few workout splits that work well for getting a V taper:</p>

                        <p>If you can only commit to working out three days a week, it's best to focus on full body workouts that prioritise compound exercises as this <br /> allows you to expose each muscle group to as much load as possible across the week.  </p>

                        <h1>HOW TO ACHIEVE V TAPER: NUTRITION</h1>
                        <p>Paying attention to your nutrition is important if you want to get a V taper. Without the right diet, it will be difficult to achieve the balance <br /> of fat loss and muscle gain needed for this body composition.</p>
                        <p>Many people will need to lose some fat to build a V taper physique as it requires low body fat to achieve the broad back to small waist V <br /> taper, however cutting your calories too low will make it much harder to build muscle. Eating at a small calorie deficit of around 200 <br /> calories will help with steady weight loss while still allowing for muscle gain.</p>
                    </div>


                    <div className='workout-vtaper-info'>
                        <h1>WHAT TO EAT</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Protein: eating plenty of protein (at least 1.4g protein per kg of bodyweight) across the day will help to keep you full while giving your <br /> body the amino acids it needs to build muscle. Aim for around 30g protein for each meal rather than eating it all in one go, choosing <br /> foods like chicken, eggs, fish, and dairy where possible and supplementing with protein shakes where necessary.</li>
                            <li>Carbs: carbohydrates provide your body with the fuel needed for intense workouts. Prioritise complex, fibre rich carbs like <br /> wholewheat pasta, sweet potatoes, and legumes.</li>
                            <li>Fats: dietary fats are important for overall health and hormones, as well as satiety (and taste!). Include small amounts of healthy <br /> fats in your meals rather than avoid this food group.</li>
                            <li>Micronutrients: aim to eat a variety of fruit and veg each day to ensure you are getting the nutrients and minerals needed for <br /> optimal health, as well as enough dietary fibre each day.</li>

                        <p>Before you begin working on your V taper physique, here are some common mistakes to avoid.</p>
                        <p></p>

                    <div className='workout-vtaper-info'>
                        <h1>NOT PROGRESSIVE OVERLOADING</h1>
                        <p>To build significant muscle and strength, you need to progressive overload your workouts. This means increasing the intensity or volume of <br /> your workouts each week by increasing the weights, reps, or workout duration, rather than doing the same amount each week.</p>
                    </div>


                    <div className='workout-vtaper-info'>
                        <h1>NOT FOLLOWING A WORKOUT PLAN</h1>
                        <p>Changing up your workouts every week makes it harder to be consistent and to increase the intensity over time, making it much harder to <br />  see results. Stick to the same exercises and workouts for at least 8-12 weeks, focusing on progressive overload. After 8-12 weeks you can <br /> adjust or switch up your workouts if preferred.</p>
                    </div>

                     <div className='workout-vtaper-info'>
                        <h1>NOT TRAINING HARD ENOUGH</h1>
                        <p>Building muscle is hard and requires the body to be sufficiently challenged. You should aim to train close to failure in your workouts, which <br /> means stopping when you’re just 1-2 reps away from being unable to lift another rep.</p>
                    </div>

                     <div className='workout-vtaper-info'>
                        <h1>OVERTRAINING OBLIQUES</h1>
                        <p>Training obliques is important in building a V taper physique, but you should avoid building too much muscle mass here as it can thicken the <br /> waist, making that V shape less pronounced.</p>
