                    <h1>WHAT ARE REPS AND SETS?</h1>

                    <p>Reps, short for repetitions, refers to one full movement of an exercise from start to finish. Sets are a group of reps performed after each <br /> other without rest, with a rest interval between each set.</p>

                    <p>For example, 3 sets of 8 squats would be doing 8 squats in a row, three times with a rest in between each set of eight.</p>

                    <p>Reps and sets are important to help structure your workouts and keep track of your progress.</p>

                    <h1>ARE REPS OR SETS MORE IMPORTANT?</h1>

                    <p>Reps and sets are a way to plan and progress your workout volume, with neither more nor less important than the other: you can achieve <br />the same amount of volume doing 8 sets of 3 reps as doing 3 sets of 8 reps.</p>
                    <p>However, changing the combination of reps and sets along with the load lifted can help you to achieve different fitness goals more effectively, which is looked at in more detail below.</p>

                <section className="sets-info-text">
                    <h1>HOW LONG BETWEEN REPS AND SETS?</h1>

                    <p>Lifting weights requires the muscles to use their energy stores to produce force. As blood is pumped around the body, it delivers oxygen <br /> and nutrients to the muscles which can be used as energy. Resting between sets allows your muscles to recover from the previous set, so <br /> that they can produce as much force and intensity in the next set.</p>

                    <p>The rest time can vary between 1 â€“ 5 minutes depending on the intensity and volume of each set.</p>

                    <h1>HOW TO CHOOSE YOUR REPS AND SETS BASED ON YOUR FITNESS GOAL</h1>

                    <p>Changing the number of reps and sets, along with the weight lifted, can help you to reach your fitness goals more effectively. For strength, <br /> go for higher weights lifted for lower reps. For maintaining or increasing muscle mass, moderate weights lifted for moderate to high reps is <br /> best.</p>

                <section className="sets-info-text">
                    <h1>HOW MANY REPS AND SETS FOR BUILDING STRENGTH?</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>3 - 5 sets</li>
                            <li>6 - 12 reps</li>
                            <li>1 - 3 minutes rest</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>When it comes to building muscle mass, moderate reps and moderate to high sets helps to create the volume and time under tension <br /> needed to stimulate muscle growth. Choose weights that take you close to failure in each set and aim to progressively overload by <br /> increasing either the weights or reps each week.</p>

                    <h1>HOW MANY REPS AND SETS FOR MAINTAINING LEAN MUSCLE?</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>3 - 4 sets</li>
                            <li>8 - 12 reps</li>
                            <li>1 - 2 minutes rest</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>Maintaining lean muscle follows the same reps and sets as fat loss and muscle hypertrophy, as the muscles still need to be stimulated to <br /> maintain their size. However, if you only want to maintain your muscle mass rather than increase it, you don't need to train as close to <br /> failure.</p>

                    <p>Because the optimal reps and sets differ for different workout goals, workout plans will look different depending on what you want to <br /> achieve. Here are some example full body workout plans for different objectives.</p>
