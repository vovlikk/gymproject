                    <h1>WHY DO DANCERS NEED TO WORK OUT?</h1>
                    <p>Dancing is an intensive form of exercise that requires a high level of fitness to perform. Whether you do break dance or ballet, you need <br /> a lot of strength to hit dance movements, hold yourself, and lift others.</p>
                    <p>Dance class conditioning is great but is limited, especially when it comes to building strength. A good my workout for dancers helps to build <br /> the strength, mobility, and endurance needed for good performance.</p>
                    <p>Training can also help to prevent injuries, as muscles become stronger, more flexible, and more resilient to handle dancing with ease.</p>

                    <h1>WHAT SHOULD A DANCER WORKOUT ROUTINE INCLUDE?</h1>
                    <h2>Dancers need a well rounded mix of training, consisting of:</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Strength training: dancers need strong muscles to get into and hold movements. Ballet dancers in particular need a lot of strength <br /> to ensure they can go on pointe and hold strong positions. </li>
                        <li>Mobility and flexibility work: dancers are required to have a high level of flexibility. While dancing itself can improve flexibility <br /> and mobility, dedicated training is more effective at building active flexibility quickly.</li>
                        <li>Cardio: cardio endurance helps with the constant movement and rising heart rate dancers need. For commercial style dances, <br /> you will need better cardio  workouts for dancers as it is requires faster moves and doesn't need as much control with the movements.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p></p>

                 <div className='workout-dance-info'>
                    <h1>HOW OFTEN SHOULD DANCERS WORK OUT?</h1>
                    <p>It's important to manage overall training volume to prevent burn out, and dancers should aim for at least one full rest day a week. An example of how weekly workouts for a dancer could look is:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Monday: 15 minutes mobility training, 45 minutes full body strength training</li>
                        <li>Tuesday: dance training</li>
                        <li>Wednesday: 30 minutes mobility training, 15 minutes core</li>
                        <li>Thursday: dance training</li>
                        <li>Friday: 30 minutes cardio, 30 minutes full body strength training</li>
                        <li>Saturday: dance training, 15 minutes flexibility training</li>
                        <li>Sunday: rest</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                 <div className='workout-dance-info'>
                    <h1>STRENGTH WORKOUT FOR DANCERS</h1>
                    <p>Strength training is highly beneficial for dancers, helping to build the strength to lift yourself and others into tricky positions. Here are some <br /> of the best exercises for dancers to include:</p>
                </div>

                 <div className='workout-dance-info'>
                    <h1>ARM WORKOUTS FOR DANCERS</h1>
                    <p>Dancers are often known for having strong, toned arms, but having a strong overall upper body is key. Compound exercises which work the <br /> chest, shoulders, and back while working the arms is the best way to build upper body and arm strength effectively.</p>

                    <h2>Key exercises:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Push ups</li>
                        <li>Shoulder press</li>
                        <li>Lat pull downs</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                 <div className='workout-dance-info'>
                    <h1>LEG WORKOUTS FOR DANCERS</h1>
                    <p>Strong legs are crucial for dancing, helping with moves as well as improving endurance. Again, choosing compound exercises allows you to <br /> train all the lower body muscle groups with fewer exercises for greater efficiency without the need for high training volume.</p>

                    <h2>Key exercises:</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Leg press</li>
                        <li>Squats</li>
                        <li>Calf raises</li>
                        <li>Lunges</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h1>AB WORKOUTS FOR DANCERS</h1>
                    <p>Having a strong core is crucial for dancers, helping with stability and coordination, flow, and injury prevention. Aim to train both core <br /> exercises (involving movement) and anti-core exercises (resisting movement).</p>

                    <h2>Key exercises:</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Planks</li>
                        <li>Sit ups</li>
                        <li>Dead bugs</li>
                        <li>Russian twists</li>

                    <h1>EXAMPLE FULL BODY WORKOUT</h1>
                    <p>Full body workouts are an effective way to train all muscle groups in one session, perfect for dancers who need to juggle dancing and <br /> training sessions each week. Here is an example full body gym workout for dancers you can try:</p>
                </div>

                 <div className='workout-dance-info'>
                    <h1>WARM UP</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>5 minutes moderate cardio</li>
                        <li>5 minutes active stretching</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                 <div className='workout-dance-info'>
                    <h1>WORKOUT</h1>
                    <h2>Squat to shoulder press – 3 x 8-12 reps</h2>
                    <p>Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding dumbbells or a barbell at shoulder height. Lower into a squat while keeping your chest up <br /> and core engaged. Push through your heels to stand back up while pressing the weights overhead until your arms are fully extended. Bring the <br /> weights back to shoulder height and repeat.</p>

                    <h2>Dumbbell lunge – 3 x 10 reps each side</h2>
                    <p>Stand with a dumbbell in each hand at your sides, feet hip width apart. Step forward with one leg and bend both knees to 90 degrees, <br /> keeping your front knee over your ankle and your back knee just above the ground. Push through the front heel to return to standing, then <br /> repeat on the other leg.</p>

                    <h2>Dumbbell hold marches – 4 x 30 seconds</h2>
                    <p>Stand with feet hip width apart and shoulder press dumbbells overhead. Keeping your arms extended, engage your core and lift one knee up <br /> towards your chest before lowering it back down and immediately repeating on the other side.</p>

                    <h2>Plank dumbbell crossover – 3 x 12-15 reps</h2>
                    <p>Start in a high plank position with a dumbbell next to one hand. Engaging the core and hips to prevent falling, reach across your body with <br /> the opposite hand to grab the dumbbell and drag it under your chest to the other side. Place the dumbbell down and repeat on the other <br /> side, alternating while maintaining a strong, steady plank throughout.</p>

                    <h2>Push ups – 4 x 6-10 reps</h2>
                    <p>Begin in a high plank position with your hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, core engaged with your body in a straight line  <br />from head to heels. Bend your elbows to lower your chest toward the floor before pushing through your palms to straighten your arms <br /> and return to the starting position.</p>

                    <h2>Around the world – 3 x 8-12 reps</h2>
                    <p>Stand with your feet around hip width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand in front of your hips with palms facing forwards. <br /> Keeping your elbows extended, lift the dumbbells out to the side and overhead in a circular movement before returning them back to the start in the <br /> same motion.</p>

                    <h2>COOL DOWN</h2>
                    <p>30-60 seconds passive stretching: shoulders, chest, back, glutes, quads, hamstrings, calves.</p>

                 <div className='workout-dance-info'>
                    <h1>FLEXIBILITY ROUTINE FOR DANCERS</h1>
                    <p>Training flexibility is key for getting into advanced dance movements without injury. Dancers need active flexibility strength to be able to <br /> pull their bodies into and hold shapes, so a dance flexibility routine should include a mix of passive and active stretches:</p>
                    <h2>Passive stretching</h2>

                    <p>Passive stretches involve using external force to stretch a muscle and holding this stretch for a period of time. They are great for <br /> increasing overall flexibility and increasing end range movement. Passive stretches should be done when the body is warm and held for 20 <br />-60 seconds per stretch.</p>

                    <h2>Active stretching</h2>
                    <p>Active stretches involve using the muscles to stretch themselves or the opposite muscle. This type of stretching increases strength at <br /> end range, making it easier to achieve flexible positions without external help. Active stretching can be done as a warm up for a workout or <br /> as part of a dedicated flexibility session.</p>

                    <h1>CARDIO WORKOUTS FOR DANCERS</h1>
                    <p>Good cardio endurance is important for dancers as they are required to constantly move while remaining in control. There are two types of <br /> cardio that are beneficial to include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Steady state cardio: moderate intensity cardio performed for 30-60 minutes can help to improve endurance for long periods of <br /> dancing.</li>
                        <li>HIIT: shorter workouts alternating periods of high intensity cardio with rest helps with overall fitness and ability to handle fast or <br /> intense movements.</li>
                    </ul>
